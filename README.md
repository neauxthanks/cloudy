# cloudy

cloudy is your go-to source for knowing what people actually want. In a world where new information is constant, miscommunication is inevitable. If you have an event and gifts are expected, do you know what you are going to bring? Probably not! You know who does! cloudy! Because cloudy will give people the chance to tell you what they want and how they want it. From bucket lists to registries to basic interests, cloudy gives people to the space to let their loved ones know what would make their day.
